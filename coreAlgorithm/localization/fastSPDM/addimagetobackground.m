%function [ diff,meanbg,newbgimage ] = addimagetobackground( bgimage, image )
%   subtract background and add new image to background
%   additionally calculates the mean value of image
%
% to avoid filling the background image with signal peaks a mask is created which
% eliminates big noise signals in the image
%
% Output:
%   diff        -background eliminated image which keeps (in best case) only
%                signal peaks
%   meanbg      -meanvalue over the whole slice to calculate noise strength
%   newbgimage  -returns the new background image for the next slice
